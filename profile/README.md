## Our Focus

We develop advanced AI systems that can read, interpret, and reason about complex construction documents — drawings, specifications, contracts, and schedules — the way an experienced professional would, but at machine scale.

Our models are trained to understand the nuances of the construction industry: scope dependencies, revision tracking, risk identification, and the intricate relationships between documents that define a project.

## The Challenge We're Solving

Construction is a $13 trillion global industry still running on fragmented information and manual review. We're changing that by applying frontier AI to unlock the intelligence trapped in project documents.

## Open Source & Community

We believe in building in the open. Explore our repositories to see what we're working on.
