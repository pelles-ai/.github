## Our Focus

We develop advanced AI systems that can **read**, **interpret**, and **reason** about complex construction documents — drawings, specifications, contracts, and schedules — the way an experienced professional would, but at machine scale.

Our models understand the nuances of construction: scope dependencies, revision tracking, risk identification, and the intricate relationships between documents that define a project.

<br>

## The Challenge

> Construction is a **$13 trillion** global industry still running on fragmented information and manual review.

We're applying frontier AI to unlock the intelligence trapped in project documents — transforming how the industry operates from bid to build.

<br>

## Building in the Open

We believe great software is built transparently. Explore our repositories to see what we're working on and join the conversation.
